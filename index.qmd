## The Problem: Mastering Object-Oriented Matplotlib Through the Four Stages

**Core Question:** How can we create compelling, professional data visualizations using object-oriented matplotlib and the four stages of visualization?

**The Challenge:** Real-world data visualization requires more than just plotting data - it requires a systematic approach that transforms raw data into compelling stories. The four stages framework provides a proven methodology for creating visualizations that inform, persuade, and inspire action.

**Our Approach:** We'll work with baseball stadium data to investigate whether Coors Field in Denver, Colorado is truly the most run-friendly ballpark in Major League Baseball. This investigation will take us through all four stages of visualization, demonstrating object-oriented matplotlib techniques along the way.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è AI Partnership Required

This challenge pushes boundaries intentionally. You'll tackle problems that normally require weeks of study, but with Cursor AI as your partner (and your brain keeping it honest), you can accomplish more than you thought possible.

**The new reality:** The four stages of competence are Ignorance ‚Üí Awareness ‚Üí Learning ‚Üí Mastery. AI lets us produce Mastery-level work while operating primarily in the Awareness stage. I focus on awareness training, you leverage AI for execution, and together we create outputs that used to require years of dedicated study.

## The Four Stages of Data Visualization

The four essential stages for creating effective visualizations are:

1. **Stage 1: Declaration of Purpose** - Define your message and audience
2. **Stage 2: Curation of Content** - Gather and create all necessary data
3. **Stage 3: Structuring of Visual Mappings** - Choose geometry and aesthetics
4. **Stage 4: Formatting for Your Audience** - Polish for professional presentation

## Data and Business Context

We analyze Major League Baseball stadium data to investigate whether Coors Field in Denver, Colorado is truly the most run-friendly ballpark. This dataset is ideal for our analysis because:

- **Real Business Question:** Sports analysts and fans want to understand stadium effects on scoring
- **Clear Hypothesis:** High altitude should make Coors Field more run-friendly
- **Multiple Metrics:** We can analyze both total runs and home runs
- **Visualization Practice:** Perfect for demonstrating all four stages of visualization

## Data Loading and Initial Exploration

Let's start by loading the baseball data and understanding what we're working with.

```{python}
#| label: load-data
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns

# Load 2010 baseball season data
df2010 = pd.read_csv("baseball10.csv")

# Load 2021 baseball season data for comparison
df2021 = pd.read_csv("baseball21.csv")

print("2010 data shape:", df2010.shape)
print("2021 data shape:", df2021.shape)
print("\n2010 data columns:", df2010.columns.tolist())
print("\nFirst few rows of 2010 data:")
print(df2010.head())
```

::: {.callout-note}
## üí° Understanding the Data

**Baseball Game Data:** Contains information about each game, including:
- `home`: Home team (3-letter code)
- `visiting`: Visiting team (3-letter code)
- `homeScore`: Runs scored by home team
- `visScore`: Runs scored by visiting team
- `homeHR`: Home runs by home team
- `visHR`: Home runs by visiting team
- `date`: Game date

**Business Questions We'll Answer:**
1. Is Coors Field (COL) the most run-friendly ballpark in 2010?
2. How does this change in 2021?
3. What's the difference between total runs and home runs by stadium?
:::

## Stage 1: Declaration of Purpose

**Mental Model:** Start with a clear message and bold title that states your recommendation.

Our purpose is to investigate whether Coors Field in Denver, Colorado is truly the most run-friendly baseball stadium in Major League Baseball.

::: {.callout-important}
## ü§î Discussion Questions: Stage 1 - Declaration of Purpose

**Question 1: Hypothesis Formation**
- Why might high altitude affect baseball performance?  Is Coors Field affected by high altitude?
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Section 1 Answers: Declaration of Purpose

- Thinner air at high altitudes reduces drag and pitch movement, letting balls travel farther ‚Äî increasing offensive output.
- Coors Field is affected by high altitude because it is located at a high altitude in Denver, Colorado.
:::

## Stage 2: Curation of Content

**Mental Model:** Gather and create all the data you need to support your message.

Let's aggregate the data to get average runs per stadium:

```{python}
#| label: stage-2-content
#| echo: true

# Stage 2: Curation of Content
# Aggregate data to get average runs per stadium

# Process 2010 data
avgDF_2010 = (df2010
    .assign(totalRuns = lambda df: df.homeScore + df.visScore)
    .assign(totalHR = lambda df: df.homeHR + df.visHR)
    .drop(columns = ['date', 'visiting'])
    .groupby(['home'], as_index=False)
    .mean()
)

# Process 2021 data
avgDF_2021 = (df2021
    .assign(totalRuns = lambda df: df.homeScore + df.visScore)
    .assign(totalHR = lambda df: df.homeHR + df.visHR)
    .drop(columns = ['date', 'visiting'])
    .groupby(['home'], as_index=False)
    .mean()
)

print("2010 Stadium Averages (Top 5):")
print(avgDF_2010.head())
print("\n2021 Stadium Averages (Top 5):")
print(avgDF_2021.head())
```

::: {.callout-important}
## ü§î Discussion Questions: Stage 2 - Curation of Content

**Question 1: Data Aggregation Strategy**
- How many games are in the dataset? Why do we aggregate individual games into stadium averages before we start the visualization process?
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Section 2 Answers: Curation of Content

```{python}
print("There are " + str(len(df2010)) + " games in the dataset for 2010.")
print("There are " + str(len(df2021)) + " games in the dataset for 2021.")

```
- We aggregate by home so it groups games by the home stadium or home team ‚Äî and then takes the mean of the numeric columns. We do this to get a single value for each stadium. This is the average runs and home runs per game for each stadium. This reduced noise and is easier to visualize and help us answer if Coors Field is the most run-friendly ballpark in 2010 and 2021.

## Stage 3: Structuring of Visual Mappings

**Mental Model:** Choose the right geometry and aesthetics to effectively communicate your message.

Let's explore different visual approaches:

```{python}
#| label: stage-3-mapping-exploration
#| echo: true

# Stage 3: Structuring of Visual Mappings
# Explore different geometries and aesthetics

# Sort data for better visualization
avgDF_2010_sorted = avgDF_2010.sort_values('totalRuns', ascending=True)

# Create figure with subplots to compare approaches
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(8, 6))

# Approach 1: Scatter plot (not ideal for categorical data)
axes[0,0].scatter(avgDF_2010_sorted.home, avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns)
axes[0,0].set_title("Approach 1: Scatter Plot")
axes[0,0].set_xlabel("Stadium")
axes[0,0].set_ylabel("Average Runs")

# Approach 2: Horizontal bar chart (better for categorical data)
axes[0,1].barh(avgDF_2010_sorted.home, avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns)
axes[0,1].set_title("Approach 2: Horizontal Bar Chart")
axes[0,1].set_xlabel("Average Runs")
axes[0,1].set_ylabel("Stadium")

# Approach 3: Vertical bar chart
axes[1,0].bar(avgDF_2010_sorted.home, avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns)
axes[1,0].set_title("Approach 3: Vertical Bar Chart")
axes[1,0].set_xlabel("Stadium")
axes[1,0].set_ylabel("Average Runs")
axes[1,0].tick_params(axis='x', rotation=45)

# Approach 4: Highlight Colorado
colorado_colors = ["darkorchid" if stadium == "COL" else "lightgrey" 
                   for stadium in avgDF_2010_sorted.home]
axes[1,1].barh(avgDF_2010_sorted.home, avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns, color=colorado_colors)
axes[1,1].set_title("Approach 4: Highlight Colorado")
axes[1,1].set_xlabel("Average Runs")
axes[1,1].set_ylabel("Stadium")

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

::: {.callout-important}
## ü§î Discussion Questions: Stage 3 - Structuring of Visual Mappings

**Question 1: Geometry Choices**
- Why is a horizontal bar chart better than a scatter plot for this data?
- When would you choose a vertical bar chart over horizontal?

**Question 2: Aesthetic Mappings**
- What does the color highlighting accomplish in Approach 4?
- How does position (x/y) compare to color for encoding data?

:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Section 3 Answers: Structuring of Visual Mappings
**Answer 1 Geometry Choices: **
- A horizontal bar chart is better than a scatter plot for this data because it is easier to compare the runs per game for each stadium. The stadium names are categorical and often long, so placing them on the y-axis keeps the labels readable. The bar lengths clearly show differences in average runs, making comparisons straightforward, while a scatter plot would be less effective for displaying one numeric variable across categories.
- You would choose a vertical bar chart over horizontal when you want to compare the runs per game for each stadium and the stadiums are not too many. A vertical bar chart is better when you have a small number of categories and want to compare their values.
**Answer 2 Aesthetic Mappings: **
- The color highlighting draws attention to specific stadiums or patterns in the data. In this case, it accomplishes that Colorado is the most run-friendly ballpark in 2010.
- Position (x/y) is the most accurate way to show numerical differences because people can easily compare how high, low, long, or short something is on a chart. It‚Äôs best for showing quantitative values like average runs per game.
Color, on the other hand, is better for showing categories or groups and for drawing attention to certain data points. It helps the viewer quickly see patterns or differences, but it‚Äôs less precise for comparing exact values.

## Stage 4: Formatting for Your Audience

**Mental Model:** Polish your visualization for professional presentation.

Let's create a publication-ready visualization:

```{python}
#| label: stage-4-formatting
#| echo: true

# Stage 4: Formatting for Your Audience
# Create a professional, publication-ready visualization

# Set style for professional appearance
plt.style.use("seaborn-v0_8-whitegrid")

# Create the main visualization
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 6))

# Create color array for highlighting Colorado
colorado_colors = ["darkorchid" if stadium == "COL" else "lightgrey" 
                   for stadium in avgDF_2010_sorted.home]

# Create horizontal bar chart
bars = ax.barh(avgDF_2010_sorted.home, avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns, color=colorado_colors)

# Add title and labels
ax.set_title("Colorado (COL) is the Most Run-Friendly Ballpark in 2010", 
             fontsize=16, fontweight='bold', pad=20)
ax.set_xlabel("Average Runs Per Game", fontsize=12)
ax.set_ylabel("Stadium (Home Team)", fontsize=12)

# Add legend
colorado_bar = plt.Rectangle((0,0),1,1, color="darkorchid", label="Colorado Rockies")
other_bar = plt.Rectangle((0,0),1,1, color="lightgrey", label="Other Stadiums")
ax.legend(handles=[colorado_bar, other_bar], loc='lower right', frameon=True)

# Add annotation for Colorado
colorado_index = avgDF_2010_sorted[avgDF_2010_sorted.home == "COL"].index[0]
colorado_runs = avgDF_2010_sorted[avgDF_2010_sorted.home == "COL"]["totalRuns"].iloc[0]
ax.annotate(f"COL: {colorado_runs:.2f} runs/game", 
            xy=(colorado_runs, colorado_index), 
            xytext=(colorado_runs + 0.5, colorado_index),
            arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->', color='darkorchid', lw=2),
            fontsize=10, fontweight='bold', color='darkorchid')

# Set x-axis to start from 0 for better comparison
ax.set_xlim(0, max(avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns) * 1.1)

# Add grid for easier reading
ax.grid(True, alpha=0.3)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Print summary statistics
print(f"\nSummary Statistics for 2010:")
print(f"Colorado (COL) average runs per game: {colorado_runs:.2f}")
print(f"League average runs per game: {avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns.mean():.2f}")
print(f"Colorado is {((colorado_runs / avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns.mean()) - 1) * 100:.1f}% above league average")
```

::: {.callout-important}
## ü§î Discussion Questions: Stage 4 - Formatting for Your Audience

**Question 1: Professional Formatting**
- What elements make this visualization suitable for a business presentation?
- Is the annotation on the visualization helpful?  Can you fix its placement?

## Advanced Object-Oriented Techniques

**Mental Model:** Use object-oriented matplotlib to create complex, reusable visualizations.

Let's create a comprehensive comparison between 2010 and 2021:

```{python}
#| label: advanced-oo-techniques
#| echo: true

# Advanced Object-Oriented Techniques
# Create a comprehensive comparison visualization

# Prepare data for comparison
comparison_data = pd.merge(
    avgDF_2010[['home', 'totalRuns']].rename(columns={'totalRuns': 'runs_2010'}),
    avgDF_2021[['home', 'totalRuns']].rename(columns={'totalRuns': 'runs_2021'}),
    on='home', how='inner'
)

## TODO: Create the visualization

```

::: {.callout-important}
## ü§î Discussion Questions: Advanced Object-Oriented Techniques

**Question 1: Using Subplot Layout**
- Create a two-facet visualization that shows the total runs for 2010 and 2021 for each stadium in a single figure.  Highlight Colorado in the visualization.

**Question 2: Explanation of the Visualization**
- Ask AI To Add A Paragraph Here To Explain The Visualization
- Does AI come to the right conclusion?  If not, why not?
